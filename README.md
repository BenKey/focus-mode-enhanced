# Focus Mode Enhanced Extension

## Introduction

This extension is based on the [Focus Mode][1] extension described in the [Inject scripts into the active tab][2] page.

The original [Focus Mode][1] extension only supported the [Chrome Developers][3] website. This extension supports several additional websites.

The purpose of this extension is to hide extraneous elements on a web page that distract from reading the actual content of the web page. This makes it much easier to read the web page using a screen reader or an extension such as the [Read Aloud: A Text to Speech Voice Reader][4] extension for Google Chrome.

## Supported Websites

* The original Chrome Developers websites supported by the [Focus Mode][1] extension.
